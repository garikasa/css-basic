    <h1 class="title Bungee, sans-serif">The Pyramids of Egypt</h1>
    <p class="description">
      The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt.
      Sources cite at least 118 identified "Egyptian" pyramids. Approximately 80
      pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush, now located in the modern
      country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt, most were built as
      tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and
      Middle Kingdom periods. The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at
      Saqqara, northwest of Memphis, although at least one step-pyramid-like
      structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba
      3808, which has been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with
      inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the period, suggesting
      there may have been others. The otherwise earliest among these is the
      Pyramid of Djoser built c. 2630–2610 BCE during the Third Dynasty. This
      pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the
      world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry. The
      most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of
      Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest
      structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian
      pyramid and the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in
      existence, despite being the oldest by about 2,000 years.
